# Hi, I'm mirkzx04

I'm a student at **Sapienza University of Rome**, pursuing a degree in **Mathematical Sciences for Artificial Intelligence**.

I am deeply passionate about Deep Learning. I enjoy not just using existing architectures, but re-implementing them from scratch to truly understand their inner workings. I love the challenge of fine-tuning models, experimenting with hyperparameters, and exploring different optimization techniques.

To stay current, I'm an avid reader of AI research papers—from foundational works to cutting-edge studies. I'm driven by the challenge of applying these theoretical concepts to solve real-world problems and explore my own experimental ideas (like my PCE project).

Currently, I am fascinated by Generative AI and the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm particularly captivated by their emergent, human-like behaviors: not only their incredible capabilities but also their intriguing "flaws," such as sycophancy, which I find a compelling area of study.
