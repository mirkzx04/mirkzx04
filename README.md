# Hi, I'm Mirko

I’m a student at Sapienza University of Rome, studying Mathematical Sciences for Artificial Intelligence.

I’m genuinely passionate about Deep Learning not just using models, but rebuilding them from scratch to understand every detail. I like experimenting with architectures, testing different hyperparameters, and playing with optimization techniques to see how they shape a model’s behavior.

I keep up with the field by reading a lot of research papers, from classic works to the latest releases. I enjoy taking these theoretical ideas and trying to apply them to real problems or to my own projects, like the PCE experiment I’m working on.

Right now, I’m especially interested in Generative AI and the fast progress of Large Language Models. Their emergent, almost human-like behaviors fascinate me not just their strengths, but also their quirky limitations, like sycophancy, which I find particularly interesting to study.
